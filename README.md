Algorithms and Data structures in Java
Hello guys and welcome to my small GitHub project dedicated to algorithms and data structures. 
First of all i want to say that i'm not a scientist or some kind of reasearcher. 
I'm just a student who wants to understand the basics of computer science. 
This little project helps me to understand how to implement different algorithms and data structures to the real programs. 
In the university i just learned some theoretical basics about it but did not implement them into real programs. 
But i want to fill this emptiness in my knowledges by writing some usefull programs with different algorithms and data structures.
I hope that this will help me to improve my knowledges in computer science and maybe you will find it usefull too.
All examples were written in Java programming language. 
I believe that Java is very convinient for that purpose and it has a very large comunity.
I will be very thankful for all advices, constructive criticism and comments. 
I will try to add more interesting apps later. 
Thank you!
